***We are a group of designers and developers working on our NFT label inside Hedera network.***

We had to create different tools on our NFT journey for the minting and other stuff so now that we have them ready and because we love this community so much, we want to release and open-source them free for all the creators out there on Hedera ecosystem ;)

HederaverseNFT Toolkit is a chrome extension for NFT creators to connect their accounts and mint their NFTs with ease!

## BE CAREFUL!
Since this tool was only tested with our needs therefore it might have different bugs so if you ever encountered any of these errors or bugs please contact us via our Discord, Twitter.

Please help us with your feedback and suggestions ;)


## How to use

The extension is really straightforward and all you have to do is to install it on your chrome browser! and then:

1- Connect your Hedera account (Testnet and Mainnet) using the connect button!

2- Create a new [nft.storage](https://nft.storage) account or use the one you already have and paste your nft.storage API key in the settings tab inside the extension.

3- Choose the metadata version you like! (we recommend using V2 which is the default)

4- Make sure you have enough HBARS in your account and start minting :)

## Do you want to run the code yourself?

You can also run the code on your local PC all you have to do is:

1- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your device

2- Open Terminal

3- Go to your project directory

4- Run in terminal `npm install -g @angular/cli`

5- Then `npm install`

6- And `ng serve` then navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) or you can use `ng serve --open` to open the page automatically!
